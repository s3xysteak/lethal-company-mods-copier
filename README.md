# Lethal Company Mods Copier

English | [简体中文](./README-zh.md)

## Features

This program will copy mod files and folders in the same directory to the game directory of Lethal Company. This is useful for distributing and facilitating installation for friends who are too lazy to install `r2modman` after creating mod packs with `r2modman`.

## :warning: Notes

The program will copy files, so you should not run programs from suspicious sources. Make sure this program comes from the release of this repository, as this is the only official way. If you are a user of the mod pack, make sure the mod pack comes from a source you trust.

Not tested on Mac and Linux. As a developer, I guess this program can only run on Windows 10/11.

## Usage

- Download the compiled `lethal-company-mods-copier.exe` file from [the latest release](https://github.com/s3xysteak/lethal-company-mods-copier/releases).
- Prepare your mod pack.
- Make sure you have Lethal Company installed.
- Place the compiled file in the same directory as the mod pack. The directory should look like this when finished:

```

- Mod Pack
  - _state
  - BepInEx
  - doorstop_config.ini
  - mods.yml
  - winhttp.dll
  - lethal-company-mods-copier.exe // Here!

```

- Run `lethal-company-mods-copier.exe`, click the button and wait for it to finish. You can close the program directly after completion.
